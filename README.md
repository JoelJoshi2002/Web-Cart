This shopping cart page is part of a larger website created using the React JavaScript library. The purpose of this page is to display the items that a user has added to their cart and provide them with the option to modify or remove items, as well as proceed to checkout.
# Installation and Setup

To use this shopping cart page, you will need to have a React project set up. Follow the steps below to integrate the shopping cart page into your React project:

1. Download the code from the repository
2. Add the code to your existing project
3. Call the jsx file for the cart in APP.jsx

# Using the Shopping Cart Page

Once the shopping cart page has been integrated into your React project, users can interact with it by adding items to their cart from other pages in your website. When they navigate to the shopping cart page, they will see a list of the items in their cart, along with the quantity, price, and total cost for each item.

Users can modify the quantity of an item in their cart by clicking the "+" or "-" buttons next to the item's quantity. They can also remove an item from their cart entirely by clicking the "Remove" button next to the item.

When the user is ready to proceed to checkout, they can click the "Checkout" button at the bottom of the page. This will take them to a checkout page where they can enter their billing and shipping information and complete their purchase.
